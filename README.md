WriteDocx.jl allows to construct `.docx` files as commonly used with Microsoft Word.
This package does not attempt to cover the full spec but supports the most common elements, with more to be added whenever there's a need.
WriteDocx.jl currently covers only writing, not reading / modifying documents.
